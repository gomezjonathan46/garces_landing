## Background

Thanks to Will Murdoch and the Brownstein Group, I was provided the images to complete this landing page.  The initial code for this project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I converted this project from a static one to an interactive one by modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file using Vanilla JavaScript.

## How to Play

Click on the gray cards to flip them over and see their face. Match the cards by their face. Try to match all the cards in as few moves and time as possible. Use the reset button to reset the game at any time. Once all cards have matched you may play again or close the window.

## Dependencies

This project was created using a plethora of resources, some of which include the following:
* Use of the font-awesome library for CSS
* Use of Google API's
* Use of Stack Overflow to shuffle list of cards
* Use of Stack Overflow to add a timer
