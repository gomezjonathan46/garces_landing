## Background

Thanks to Will Murdoch and the Brownstein Group, I was provided the images to complete this landing page. I used the mockup as a guiding template to create and style this landing page. A mobile design was not provided, so I had the opportunity to get creative!

## Dependencies

This project was created using a plethora of resources, some of which include the following:
* Use of Google Fonts
* Use of Stack Overflow
* Use of Bootstrap

See comments in the code for more dependencies.

## Contributing

Feedback is welcome, please submit a pull request or contact me with questions. Thanks!
